## ü§ù How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds‚Äîbug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, or feedback!
LibreCourse uses the **pull request workflow**. Here‚Äôs how you can get involved:

### üîÑ Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the repository**
   Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this repo to create your own copy.

2. **Clone your fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LibreCourse.git
   cd LibreCourse
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment**
   Run the setup script:

   ```bash
   python3 dev_jumpstart.py
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with at least:

   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

   Optional (a local SQLite3 fallback is implemented if not set):

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/librecourse
   ```

5. **Create a new branch**
   Always work in a feature branch, not in `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Make your changes**

   * Follow the existing code style and conventions.
   * Keep commits focused and meaningful.

7. **Test your changes**
   Make sure the project runs properly:

   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Commit & push**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: short description of changes"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

9. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   Go to the original repository and open a PR from your branch.

   * Clearly describe what you changed and why.
   * Reference related issues if applicable (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

---

### ‚úÖ Contribution Guidelines

* Keep PRs small and focused‚Äîone feature/fix per PR is best.
* Update documentation if your changes affect usage.
* Be respectful and constructive in discussions.
* All contributions are reviewed before merging.

## ü§ù Contributions - Project Setup

To make it easier for contributors to set up the project on **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian, Arch-based)** and other supported systems, we provide a single script: `dev_jumpstart.py`.

This script automates the entire environment setup process so you don‚Äôt have to manually install or configure dependencies.

### üîß What `dev_jumpstart.py` does

Running the script will:

1. **Detect your operating system** (Ubuntu/Debian, Arch Linux, or others).
2. **Ensure system dependencies are installed**  
   - Checks and installs `curl`, `node`, and `npm` if missing or outdated.  
   - On Ubuntu/Debian, uses `apt`; on Arch, uses `pacman`.  
3. **Set up Python environment**  
   - Creates a `.venv` virtual environment (if it doesn‚Äôt exist).  
   - Installs/updates all Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  
4. **Set up Node.js environment**  
   - Installs or upgrades `node` and `npm` if necessary.  
   - Installs local `npm` dependencies including:  
     - `tailwindcss` (via `@tailwindcss/cli`)  
     - `postcss`  
     - `autoprefixer`  
   - Ensures the TailwindCSS binary is properly linked and accessible.  
5. **Run Django + Tailwind**  
   - Launches the Django development server.  
   - Starts Tailwind in watch mode so CSS updates automatically.  

At the end, you will have a fully working development environment with **Python, Django, TailwindCSS, and all project dependencies configured automatically**.

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to use it

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LibreCourse.git
   cd LibreCourse
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 dev_jumpstart.py
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è On some niche Ubuntu systems, you may need to run:
   >
   > ```bash
   > sudo apt install python3-venv
   > ```

3. The script will handle everything:

   * Install missing system packages
   * Set up Python virtualenv
   * Install Node/NPM dependencies
   * Ensure TailwindCSS is installed and ready

---

### üí° Notes

* If you see warnings from `npm`, they can usually be ignored unless they prevent installation.
* On first run, you may need to enter your system password for `sudo` commands.  

* After setup, you can re-run:

  ```bash
  python3 dev_jumpstart.py

This will **not reinstall everything from scratch**. Instead, it will:

* Check if system dependencies (`curl`, `node`, `npm`, etc.) are present and up to date.
* Check if Python dependencies in `requirements.txt` have changed and install any missing ones.
* Check if Node dependencies (`tailwindcss`, `postcss`, etc.) need updating.
* Start/Restart the **development environment** (Django server + Tailwind watcher).
